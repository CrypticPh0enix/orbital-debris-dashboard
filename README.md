# Orbital Debris Dashboard

An interactive R Shiny dashboard visualizing space debris trends across orbital layers, providing insights into the growing congestion of Earth's orbital environment.

## Dashboard: https://aj7940-roja-joshi.shinyapps.io/orbital-debris-dashboard/

### Three Main Visualizations:

1. **Time-Series Analysis**
   - Reveals exponential growth of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) debris
   - Tracks active satellites, rocket bodies, and tracked objects over time
   - Highlights long-term risks in Earth's orbital environment

2. **Orbital Layer Composition**
   - Compares debris distribution across orbital layers using box plots
   - Explains why LEO is the most crowded orbital region
   - Identifies specialized satellite systems in medium and geostationary orbits

4. **Country-Wise Debris Contribution**
   - Visualizes major nations and alliances contributing to orbital debris
   - Timeline highlighting critical space events
   - Identifies largest contributors to space debris

## Technologies Used

- **R Shiny** - Interactive web application framework
- **ggplot2** - Data visualization
- **Data Wrangling** - dplyr, tidyr

## Data Sources

- [NASA Orbital Debris Program](https://orbitaldebris.jsc.nasa.gov/quarterly-news/)
- [UCS Satellite Database](https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/satellite-database)
- [Space-Track.org](https://www.space-track.org/)

## Key Insights

- **LEO is the debris hotspot:** Most communication, Earth monitoring, and navigation satellites operate in Low Earth Orbit, making it the most congested orbital layer
- **Exponential growth:** The number of tracked objects is steadily rising, especially in LEO
- **Global footprint:** Multiple countries and space agencies contribute to orbital debris, with some nations having larger footprints than others

## Project Context

Created as part of the **Data Visualisation with R** course at RMIT University, showing skills in:
- Interactive dashboard development
- Multi-source data integration
- Data storytelling and insight communication
- Spatial and temporal data analysis
